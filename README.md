I was able create this from foillowing as I have
used:-<br>
1. Rect for the framework<br>
2. Vite for the development server and build tool<br>
3. Tailwind CSS for styling and layout<br>
4. React-Router for Navigation bar and Footer but currently it seem to be of no use, though I will try to add more functionality and bring life to the project.<br>
5. Redux-Toolkit as well, for the addTodo, and removeTodo reducers instead of traditional methods. Bringing yet another limitation that I couldn't use local storage so that Todo wouldn't be gone. I will also work on that as well redux-persist and also try to learn that.<br>
6. React Hooks for managing state and side effects in functional components. <br>
